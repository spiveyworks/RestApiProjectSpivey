# RV Coding Challenge

A new client wants to build a small API to allow users to pin areas they've visited and potentially share them with other users. The client included a set of sample data in `User.csv`, `City.csv`, and `State.csv`. Please implement a few basic operations on the data provided, including the following.

 - Listing the cities in a given state
 - Registering a visit to a particular city by a user
 - Removing a visit to a city
 - Listing cities visited by a user
 - Listing states visited by a user.  

You may use whatever language or tools you wish to complete the exercise.  Keep in mind that you may be asked to extend your solution in an on-site interview.


**Required endpoints**

1. List all cities in a state

	`GET /state/{state}/cities`
 
2. Allow to create rows of data to indicate they have visited a particular city.

	`POST /user/{user}/visits`

	```
	{
		"city": "Chicago",
		"state": "IL"
	}
	```
	
3. Allow a user to remove an improperly pinned visit.

	`DEL /user/{user}/visit/{visit}`

4. Return a list of cities the user has visited

	`GET /user/{user}/visits`
	
5. Return a list of states the user has visited

	`GET /user/{user}/visits/states`


## Things To Consider

- How should you deal with invalid or improperly formed requests?
- How should you handle requests that result in large data sets?


## Deliverables

- The source code for your solution.
- The database schema you use to implement your solution.
- Any additional documentation you feel is necessary to explain how your application works, or describe your thought process and design decisions.


## Bonus Points

- Handle authentication of users prior to allowing changes to their visits
- Make use of the lat/long data for cities in a creative way that provides additional functionality for the client


##Deployment Notes

- The SQL database is running in Azure with the following connection string:
Server=tcp:restapiprojectspiveyserver.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=restapiprojectspivey;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=restadmin;Password=Walking in the woods.;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;

- Test User in this database is user: michaelspivey@spiveyworks.com and password: TestPassword1.
